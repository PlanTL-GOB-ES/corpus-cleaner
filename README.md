# Project description

CorpusCleaner is modular and fast python-based toolkit to clean raw text corpora through generator pipelines. 
It was mainly designed to clean corpora collected from web crawlers resulting in a specific data format. 
However, due to its modularity nature, it can be customized and adapted to any data format.

### a) Data parser
### b) Encoding fixer

### d) Sentence splitter
### e) Sentence filter
### f) Normalizer
### g) Document filter
### h) Document organizer
### i) Output formatter
